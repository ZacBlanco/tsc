# Presto Optimizer Working Group Governance

This document establishes the governance principles for the Presto Optimizer Working Group (the "Optimizer WG"). The Optimizer WG operates as a working group within the framework of the [Presto Technical Charter](https://github.com/prestodb/foundation/blob/main/Presto%20Technical%20Charter%2020191015.pdf), which defines the roles and responsibilities of the Presto Technical Steering Committee (the "TSC"). The Optimizer WG is formed by the TSC as a working group under the Technical Charter. The Optimizer WG will operate in accordance with the Technical Charter, along with Presto's established policies and procedures, as further elaborated below.

## Purpose

The purpose of the Optimizer WG is to drive advancements in the Presto query optimizer, focusing on designing new improvements, monitoring the progress of ongoing initiatives, and facilitating collaborative discussions for brainstorming optimizer enhancements.

## Scope

* Collaboratively design and propose new features, algorithms, and enhancements for the Presto query optimizer.
* Monitor the progress of existing optimizer-related initiatives and projects, ensuring alignment with project goals and best practices.
* Foster an environment for open discussions and brainstorming sessions among community members to identify potential optimizer improvements.
* Provide guidance on optimizing query performance in the context of the Presto project.
* Document and share best practices, patterns, and design principles related to query optimization.

## Principles

* **Openness** and **Transparency**:
    * The Optimizer WG meetings and activities are open to all participants committed to advancing the Presto query optimizer.
    * Discussions, decisions, and proposals related to optimizer enhancements will be conducted transparently in meetings, mailing lists, or issue threads.
* **Neutrality**:
    * The Optimizer WG operates with a neutral stance, focusing on the collective benefit of the Presto project ecosystem and avoiding bias towards any specific vendor or provider of Presto-related products or services.
    * All activities within the Optimizer WG adhere to the [Antitrust Policy of The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy/).
* **Technical merit**:
    * Optimizer-related decisions, proposals, and designs should be evaluated based on technical merit, considering alignment with the Presto project's codebase and the impact on end users.
    * Participants have the opportunity to present, discuss, and advocate for the technical validity of their ideas. However, not all viewpoints will necessarily be implemented.
* **Collaboration**:
    * The Optimizer WG encourages collaboration among community members, fostering an environment where diverse perspectives contribute to creating robust and innovative optimizer improvements.
* **Progressive enhancement**:
    * Enhancements to the query optimizer should aim to progressively improve query performance, optimization accuracy, and resource efficiency over time.

## Governance

* **Working Group**:
    * The Optimizer WG is formally established as a working group within the TSC, following section 2(h)(iv) of the Presto Technical Charter.
* **Chairperson**:
    * The TSC appoints an initial Chairperson for the Optimizer WG.
    * The TSC has the authority to change or appoint a new Chairperson as necessary.
    * The current Chairperson will be listed in this document in the section below.
      * Chairperson: <PLACEHOLDER>
    * The Chairperson's responsibilities include:
        * Scheduling regular Optimizer WG community meetings.
        * Facilitating open discussions among participants.
        * Aiding the community in seeking consensus on optimizer-related matters.
        * Documenting decisions made by the community.
        * Noting areas of disagreement, if consensus is not reached, for escalation to the TSC.
        * Keeping the TSC informed about the progress of the Optimizer WG.
    * The Chairperson does not make final technical decisions if consensus cannot be reached.
* **Meetings**:
    * Participants in Optimizer WG meetings adhere to the [Presto Foundation Code of Conduct](https://github.com/prestodb/tsc/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and other relevant policies of the Presto Foundation and The Linux Foundation.
* **Decisions**:
    * The Optimizer WG operates on a consensus-based approach.
    * If consensus cannot be achieved, the Chairperson may escalate the decision to the TSC for resolution as per the Technical Charter.
* **Amendments**:
    * The TSC may revise this Working Group Governance document at its discretion and as needed.
