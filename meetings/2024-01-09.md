### Discussion Items

* [Tim Meehan] Release 0.285 is out, which includes [several enhancements](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/9ca2ea67c0a25fb3e20799c76a38cfbad4f8d663/presto-docs/src/main/sphinx/release/release-0.285.rst) to the Iceberg connector among other things
  * Jay volunteered to be 0.286 release notes shephard
* [Jason Fine] Overview of PR https://github.com/prestodb/presto/pull/21605
  * Supports equality deletes as a join in Iceberg connector
  * Background: Iceberg supports row-level deletes by keeping equality delete files and applying these deletes when reading the split data; this is especially costly for streaming implementations because the delete files must be accessed many times - specifically, (splits * delete_files) number of times
  * Implementation: the Iceberg connector optimizes the query plan when equality delete files are present by rewriting the query to use a JOIN; one scan of the table (without applying deletes) and one scan of the deletes is performed, and the data that does not match (an anti-join) is returned
    * Note: this is made possible because Presto supports the ability for connectors to optimize query plans
  * Example results: for queries a table on a partition with ~5GB of data files and ~150 delete files, CPU time of 39 seconds is achieved when using this PR vs 5.5 hours without
  * [Tim] It would be interesting to see if we could apply a similar strategy for the other table format connectors, Hudi and Delta Lake
* [Yi-Hong Wang] Overview of merged PR https://github.com/prestodb/presto/pull/21576
  * Adds a SQL console to the Presto UI page, leveraging the `presto-js-client` to run SQL queries and show results on the web UX and linking to the query results page
  * Note: a limit of 100 is automatically applied to `SELECT` queries to the effect of less memory and less impact on the presto cluster
  * Planned enhancements include adding session support, query status information and pre-empt/kill options, and query history information to the page
* [Jay Narale] Overview of merged PR https://github.com/prestodb/presto/pull/20887
  * Provides initial support for persistent Common Table Expressions (CTEs), which can lead to reductions in both storage operations and computational costs
  * Implementation: CTEs are evaluated before query execution; then, optimizers transform the plan to add a sequence node that gives the plan a DAG-type flow; CTEs are then writted to a temporary location for later consumption; all intermediate exhanges can be materialized
  * Example results: seeing ~15% improvement in CPU time in production tests
  * This is the first step towards https://github.com/prestodb/presto/issues/19744
    * The eventual goal is to materialize or stream the CTEs (either in local memory or remote) using CBO rules
  * Planned enhancements include further stability refinements, determination of heuristics for deciding the queries on which to apply these improvements, and multi-query optimization
  * Aditi and Jay to connect regarding support for persistent CTEs in Prestissimo; should be minimal in terms of work needed
